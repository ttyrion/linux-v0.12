# linux-v0.12
Source code of linux v0.12 that can be built successfully with GCC 8

## Source Code
From [old-versions Linux](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/) we can get the linux 0.12 source code. But buiding with that code will make lots of errors. Sth should be done(such as changing some of the source code) before being able to build it successfully.
